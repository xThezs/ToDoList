#Project ToDoList

Create a ToDolist with persistant data and connected to a backend in NodeJS 

We're using a BDD in docker so if you want to try this project connect your own BDD in the database.js file. 

Cors is whitelisting only the localhost / 127.0.0.1 ip if you want to use another IP you need to add the origin in the app.js file. 

We're using bootstrap file so you can run this project offline if you run the app.js and have you bdd in localhost.
